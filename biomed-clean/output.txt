BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, leptin promotes 
insulin resistance and contributes to the progression of NASH via activation of 
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). However, the pathogenic mechanisms that trigger 
HSC activation in leptin-deficient obesity are still unknown. This study aimed 
to determine how HSC-targeting lipocalin-2 (LCN2) mediates the transition from 
simple steatosis to NASH.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Male wild-type (WT) and ob/ob mice were fed a high-fat 
diet (HFD) for 20 weeks to establish an animal model of NASH with fibrosis. 
Ob/ob mice were subject to caloric restriction or recombinant leptin treatment. 
Double knockout (DKO) mice lacking both leptin and lcn2 were also fed an HFD for 
20 weeks. In addition, HFD-fed ob/ob mice were treated with gadolinium 
trichloride to deplete Kupffer cells. The LX-2 human HSCs and primary HSCs from 
ob/ob mice were used to investigate the effects of LCN2 on HSC activation. Serum 
and hepatic LCN2 expression levels were prominently increased in HFD-fed ob/ob 
mice compared with normal diet-fed ob/ob mice or HFD-fed WT mice, and these 
changes were closely linked to liver fibrosis and increased hepatic α-SMA/matrix 
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) protein levels. HFD-fed DKO mice showed a marked reduction of α-SMA 
protein compared with HFD-fed ob/ob mice. In particular, the colocalization of 
LCN2 and α-SMA was increased in HSCs from HFD-fed ob/ob mice. In primary HSCs 
from ob/ob mice, exogenous LCN2 treatment induced HSC activation and MMP9 
secretion. By contrast, LCN2 receptor 24p3R deficiency or a STAT3 inhibitor 
reduced the activation and migration of primary HSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: LCN2 acts as a key mediator of HSC activation in leptin-deficient 
obesity via α-SMA/MMP9/STAT3 signaling, thereby exacerbating NASH.
