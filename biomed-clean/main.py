    Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer with poor prognosis.
    Recent studies have focused on targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is
    frequently dysregulated in these tumors. Inhibitors such as everolimus and
    temsirolimus have shown promise in preclinical models. Additional mutations in
    TP53 and amplification of EGFR are also common in glioblastoma patients.
